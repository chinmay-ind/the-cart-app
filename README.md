# the_cart_app

Machine Test for MSIL

## Getting Started

The cart app is an app where a user can view, add, delete and rearrange the items. User can login & register themselves.
Registration requires username, password and date of birth.

Notes while reviewing the app:

1. As this test has time constraints, the app is made with the focus of functionally fit rather than a beautiful UI.
2. Shared Preference is used for locally storing the data.
3. A dummy list of 3 users and 4 products of 5 categories each has been added.
4. On Logout, data is reset to the dummy data.
5. Three users details are as follows:
    1. Username - o.pimple@gmail.com , Password - om123
    2. Username - o.tari@gmail.com , Password - omkar123
    3. Username - l.parab@gmail.com , Password - lokesh123
6. User can register themselves and then try to login.
